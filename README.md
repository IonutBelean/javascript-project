# 🌞 Project IT School Weather 🌞

This is a project for **IT School**. We learn how to use and work with API's.
For this project we use [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/), a very nice site who can track weather all over the world.

Remember, work is still in progress!

I used 4 countries and for each 10 cities to display the weather in real time.

For Romania cities I put some pics.

### Hope you like it! 😁
